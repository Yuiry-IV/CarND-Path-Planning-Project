## Intro
Goal of this project to implement a controller that will be able to drive a car over highway in virtual environment. Car should be able to change a lane, in case of obstacle detected in front of the car. Car should follow the traffic flow speed and avoid collisions with over cars. Car should stay inside marked lanes of the road. Car should avoid extrema accelerations.
